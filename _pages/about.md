Hi! I'm a Senior @ Harvard University '23 studying Biology and Statistics. I currently work in the [Hekstra lab](https://hekstralab.fas.harvard.edu) and research the protein dynamics of PTP1B through multi-temperature and electric field-stimulated X-ray crystallography (EF-X) experiments. This summer, I'm working in the [Harrison Laboratory](https://crystal.harvard.edu/) to study the structure of the kinetochore using cryo electron tomography (cryo-ET).

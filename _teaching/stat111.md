I prepared handwritten materials to lead a discussion section, held joint office hours with Ginnie Ma and Rachel Li, and graded problem sets and exams. 

Description
======
Stat111 is the introductory course to statistical inference and second foundational course in the Harvard Statistics Department. This course primarily focuses on the frequentist approach to statistics, with a significant portion of the course dedicated to maximum likelihood methods. The last third of the course discusses Bayesian approaches, design-based approaches, and casaul inference. The course was taught by the amazing Prof. Neil Shephard.

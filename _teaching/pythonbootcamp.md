I have helped out with this course during the Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 terms. I held open office hours for students both in-person and remotely. 

Description 
=====
The College Python Boot Camp introduces students to the basics of programming in Python and fundamental tools in the Scientific Python toolbox like numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn. The course is self-paced for students. The course materials were prepared by the awesome Dr. Nicholas Colella.

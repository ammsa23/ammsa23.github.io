I taught this course during the Spring 2022 term. I prepared handwritten materials to lead a discussion section, held joint office hours with Ginnie Ma and Rachel Li, and graded problem sets and exams. I co-taught this course with Julian Wagner-Carena in the Spring of 2023. 

Description
======
Stat111 is the introductory course to statistical inference and second foundational course in the Harvard Statistics Department. This course primarily focuses on the frequentist approach to statistics, with a significant portion of the course dedicated to maximum likelihood methods. The last third of the course discusses Bayesian approaches, design-based approaches, and casaul inference. The course was taught by Prof. Neil Shephard in Spring of 2022 and by Prof. Joe Blitzstein in Spring of 2023.
